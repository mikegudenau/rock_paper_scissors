The 5 elements of traditional Chinese philosopy - earth, water, fire, wood, and metal - have long been used to represent the different parts of the natual world and human experiences. Each element posesses unique properties that have influence on one another. In this game, a user has the chance to choose either the classic version of the game (water, fire, wood) or the advanced 5 element game (water, fire, wood, earth, and metal). Once the game mode is chosen, the user battles the computer for control of the leaderboard and supremacy.
