# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Abstract: 
This element Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a new twist on the classic game that everyone knows and loves. The 5 elements of traditional Chinese philosophy - earth, water, fire, wood, and metal - have long been used to represent the different parts of the natural world and human experiences. Each element possesses unique properties that have an influence on one another. In this game, a user can choose either the classic version of the game (water, fire, wood) or the advanced 5-element game (water, fire, wood, earth, and metal). Once the game mode is chosen, the user battles the computer to control the leaderboard and supremacy.

## Learning Goals:
- Demonstrate understading of 
  - DRY Javascript
  - Event delegation
- Relationship between the data model and them DOM 
- Git workflow

## WINS + Challenges

### Wins:
- Being able to problem solve when switching from the game back to the central game board. Using too many hide-and-show functions was presenting issues. A proper fix strategy was to use innerHTML for the fighter choices instead of hard coding them to the HTML document.
- Trusting myself to use problem-solving techniques.

### Challenges 
- Using event listeners to target elements not initially on the DOM.
- Working on a larger project individually.
